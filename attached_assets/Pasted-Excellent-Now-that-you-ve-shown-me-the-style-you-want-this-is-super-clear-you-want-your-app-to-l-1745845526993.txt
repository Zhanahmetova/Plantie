Excellent! Now that you’ve shown me the style you want —
this is super clear: you want your app to look very similar to the screenshots you uploaded — fresh, airy, elegant, with soft colors, rounded elements, minimal clutter, and a focus on beautiful plant visuals.

Here’s the perfect Uizard prompt based on the design you uploaded:

Would you also like me to give you ready-made names for the navigation tabs and sections, so you can drop them into Uizard directly too? 🚀💚
(For example: what to call each tab like “Today”, “My Garden”, “History”, etc.) — it will make the project feel completely real!
